# Codeway Backend Case Challenge
I am asked to create an infrastructure on Google Cloud which collects userâ€™s event logs and stores in BigQuery and also serves the aggregated data stored.

Two services are implemented to maintain the infrastructure. Event Logs Service is to add event logs to and retrieve from the Big Query. Stats Service is to return some statistical data about the event logs, such as daily users.
Both services are currently running in separate machines in Google Cloud using Cloud Run. For applying the microservice architecture, I could have also chosen using NGINX or HEROKU, but I wanted to try Cloud Run in Google Cloud.
